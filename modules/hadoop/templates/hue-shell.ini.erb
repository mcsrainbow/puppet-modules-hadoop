[shell]
## These are commented out so you know where to put lines like these if necessary.

## The shell_buffer_amount specifies the number of bytes of output per shell
## that the Shell app will keep in memory. If not specified, it defaults to
## 524288 (512 MiB).
#shell_buffer_amount=100

## If you run Hue against a Hadoop cluster with Kerberos security enabled, the
## Shell app needs to acquire delegation tokens for the subprocesses to work
## correctly. These delegation tokens are stored as temporary files in some
## directory. You can configure this directory here. If not specified, it
## defaults to /tmp/hue_delegation_tokens.
#shell_delegation_token_dir=/tmp/hue_delegation_tokens
